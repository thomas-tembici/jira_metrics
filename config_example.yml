# Query - a JQL query to gather data, if you are smart you will remove Epics, Sub-tasks and other items like the example bellow.
# NOTE: if you add more than 1 issuetype on JQL all of them must share the same workflow statuses!
Query:
    project = WO AND issuetype not in (Epic, Sub-task, Bug-task) AND resolution in (Done) AND resolutiondate >= "2020-11-07" AND resolutiondate <= "2021-02-07"

# Workflow - you can group status in a similar way that you group more than 1 status in a column in your jira board
Workflow: 
    Backlog: Backlog
    Discovery:
        - Research
        - Ideation
        - Validation
        - Refining
    Refinement: Refinement
    Ready to Develop: Ready to Develop
    Development: 
        - Development
        - Selected for Development
    In Progress: In Progress
    Code Review: Code Review
    Review: Review

# Right now you can't change the 3 types: Story, Bug, Task, but you can group other jira issuetypes in each of those 3 options
Issuetype:
    Story: Story
    Bug: Bug
    Task:
        - Task
        - Technical debt

# Cycletime - A list of which columns the script should consider to calculate the cycletime
Cycletime:
    - Development
    - In Progress
    - Code Review
    - Review
    - Homolog
    - Ready to Deploy
    - Done

# Simulations - how many simulations we should run 10k should give you a good result
# Source - Which Throughput/day we should use to run the simulation, must be Story, Bug, Task or Throughput (sum of all 3)
Montecarlo:
    Simulations: 10000
    Simulation Start Date: 2021-02-07
    Simulation End Date: 2021-03-10
    Source: Story

# Percentiles - that the script should return, the script will return the nearest neighbor result
